Made a reques to the API Deck Cards API to render the cards and then wrote the logic to check the values of each card drawn by the players so that the winner was the one with the highest value and used CSS to create the front end. 

## Optimizations
Adding a new gameplay for one player where they can play BlackJack.

## Lessons Learned:
Connecting, making requests to public API'S writing the logic for the game designing the front end that interacts with the data so the user can play it.
